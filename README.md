# Invaders
Doing a basic invaders to teach myself ECS, win32, Audio and Multithreading and a bunch of other things

The ECS way is to create systems or components to solve things
* Needs extra data for something
    * Create a component
* Then create the system that solves that problem

# Things i'd like to solve in this project
* ECS
* Basic Audio
* Software Renderer
* Basic UI
* OpenGL renderer


# Things i'd like to solve in the next project
* Use a meter convention
* More advanced rendering
    * Reflections
    * Transparent objects
* Asset Loader
* Font rendering
* Linux support
* D3D11 Support
* Record and store inputs for playback
* SIMD
* Work Queue
* Roll your own printf
* Improved Font rendering
* Write an actual lexer/parser for custom file formats


# ToDo

* OpenGL renderer
  * Precompile/init shaders (from a file or just list in the code)
* UI
